# Loan Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model for predicting loan approval or rejection based on historical data. The model is trained on a 
 dataset containing information about past loan applications, and it aims to predict whether a new loan application is likely to be approved or rejected.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for running notebooks)
- pip install -r requirements.txt
 1. Explore the dataset:
  Open and run the data_exploration.ipynb notebook to understand the structure of the dataset and its features.

2.Train the machine learning model:
  Open and run the model_training.ipynb notebook to train the loan prediction model using the provided dataset.
  finally get the accuray.
